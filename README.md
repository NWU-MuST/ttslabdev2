TTS Lab 2 development tools
===========================

This repository contains a collection of smaller tools and scripts to compile acoustic models and voices for the [TTSLab2 toolkit][1].

Since the tools in this repository vary in maturity and robustness, perhaps the best way to start using this is to refer to the voice build repositories (e.g. [Lwazi2 Afrikaans][2]) for installation instructions and scripts to compile voices from data that has been pre-setup.
